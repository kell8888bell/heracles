# Kelley's Heracles Notes

## My Plan
  As suggested: A simplesimple HTML page with an input box, it uses a bit of javascript and HTML.

  I am creating a small suite of test cases in Python using Selenium WebDriver and pytest. There are some basic GUI tests, that can be expanded, I have put information in the comments. There are the tests to check that it is doing the work it is supposed to do, so an array of inputs. The third block is the Acceptance Tests that are specified in the requirements.

## Installed Software
  * git
  * Python 3.7.3
  * Selenium WebDriver - using with Chromedriver
  * pytest
  * Python SimpleHTTPServer
      * python -m http.server 1337
      * http://localhost:1337/FormatMoney.html
